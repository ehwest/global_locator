<br>The goal of this site is to share accurate location and contact information for ?churches of Christ? worldwide.    

Generally, these churches --in the United States-- are distinctive with respect to certain Christian worship practices.
<br>
Of course exceptions and variations exist, certainly across language and national boundaries.  

ChurchZip does NOT include all churches of any kind or type.
<br><br>As a service to the majority of users visiting this site,
we limit our scope to churches world-wide having all of following practices:
<br>

<nl>
<li>
We only serve churches not otherwise served by any existing denominational headquarters site.   
</li>
<li>
We only serve churches that use no clergy/laity titles and/or distinctive garments in worship services. 
</li>
<li>
We only serve churches that celebrate the Lord?s Supper on a regular weekly basis. 
</li>
</nl>
<br>
You may have noticed some <b>important changes</b> recently made.
Without taking anything away,
we have added 10 new information elements to each record to help our users find what they are looking for.
<br>
<br>
These additional information elements aim to fully disclose uncommon but evolving church practices  
among listed churches.
<br>
<br>
We are expecting churches to self-identify their own records with respect to these questions of worship practice.
Of course we scour the web daily to find updates to our records.
<br>
<br>These new facts captured are:
<br>
<br>
<nl>
<li>
<b>Egalitarian</b>   (yes/no/unreported)  This term is often contrasted to a "Complementarian" theology where only men take the lead in all parts of the worship service.  A church having an egalitarian theology would have both men and women taking the lead in varous services.
<li>
<b>Multi-Campus</b>  (yes/no/unreported)   Certain churches have established multiple sites for worship, under the governance of a mother congregation.
<li>
<b>Instrumental or Band</b> (yes/no/unreported)
<li>
<b>Both Instrumental AND Acappella</b> Worship Services (yes/no/unreported)  Certain churches have "both" instrumental and acappella services, sometimes at different times.  
<li>
<b>Social Media Presence</b> (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube, LiveStream).   Some churches use one or more of thes social media platforms as an alternative or supplement to a web site.  We capture the address of that information for churches who use this.
</nl>
<br><br>
<br>
These new pieces of information are intended to save people time in finding what they are looking for.

This information therefore is absolutely "unofficial" and should only be considered
a casual work, subject to errors and omissions of all kinds,  and numerous ad-hoc contributors.
At the same time, I would very much like to receive corrections, and you can submit them yourself at any time.
To correct the information for a particular church, display it in the search list or map, and click on "Edit" on the record to provide
your changes.   
<br>We vet all submissions within a few days.
<br>

To add records <a href=http://churchzip.com/newplace-1.htm >CLICK HERE TO ADD NEW RECORDS</a>.  This procedure
attempts to affix the location before adding details to the new record.
This enables us to include listings of churches in countries not having standardized street addresses.
It is my goal to have the largest and most accurate directory of churches of Christ, worldwide.

<br>Users should be aware that we are unable to know about any of the more subjective loves, beliefs,  teaching, theology, fellowships, conventions, institutional affinity, and/or periodical alignment held by the church leader(s) or any members of any church.  
Moreover, the  criteria above may very well be met by churches not using the nom de guerre "Church of Christ." 
Some church names we have seen include "The Lord's Church," and  "The Way."  We have also seen numerous alternatives in non-English-speaking countries.
We have no specific criteria regarding a church's provenance, restoration history, or state of fellowship among other churches.

There is <b>no cost</b> for users or churches to utilize this site!  Please do not ever PAY someone to correct their information.

get through, and email is a good way to fix any point of confusion.
